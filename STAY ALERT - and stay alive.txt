* STAY ALERT - and stay alive. The more awake a worker is, the less likely he or she is to get hurt. If you are unsure how to operate equipment or perform a task, ask your supervisor. Don't guess and muddle through. Make sure you know in advance the correct, safe way to do it.
* WEAR THE RIGHT CLOTHES - work clothes should fit properly. Anything that can catch in machinery or trip you up is hazardous. Wear protective clothing and equipment as required.
* USE THE RIGHT TOOLS - if you need a hammer, get a hammer. It may be handier to use a pair of pliers, wrench or screw driver, but you are more likely to get injured.
* LEARN HOW TO LIFT - Lifting takes more than muscle; it is an art. Don't try to show how strong you are; you may end up in a hospital. Get help to handle anything that is too heavy or cumbersome for you.
* DON'T BE A PRANKSTER - practical jokes and horseplay can be dangerous, especially around heavy machinery. If you feel the urge to play, resist it until after work.
* BE TIDY - Good housekeeping reduces hazards in the workplace or your home. Always put away tools when they are not in use. Keep the floors clean, pick up scraps and wipe up spills. A slip or trip can be fatal.
